UI

** Nav Bar **
Add * Search * Calendar * Settings

*** Add ***
Global Icon to add location
Thumbs Up Icon to add likability - 1 to 10
Want to visit again - yes, no, maybe
Date Visited - today... (can change)
Weather - (get current)
Notes (optional) textbox entry

*** Search ***
search text
near (location, including "here")
date range
likability
Want to visit again

*** Calendar ***
basically, something that looks like ez2ki6


VERY Possible re-name:
easychizuroku
ez7zu6
ez2ki6

integration
ez2ki6 - for this, we'll need to pass in something for notes
can we just have ez2ki6 as a separate plugin, or ...?
what's the best way to integrate it?
	best idea?
		just re-use the components ... don't actually integrate with the complete app ... this version would just use 1 calendar 
		possible to use as an npm package??
concerns:
	data location
	users only have access to their own data
