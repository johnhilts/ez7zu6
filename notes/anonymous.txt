anonymous users ...

Trying to save some data, but didn't login?
	show a nice alert with a link to let someone login WITHOUT MESSING UP WHATEVER IT WAS THAT THEY WERE DOING

check for session cookie ... if not there, then add it, add new user, add to local storage
	no expiration - the local storage will help with that!

merge (reconciliation) 
if you have a session cookie but are anonymous, then when you login, your session will just become un-anonymous!
	no expiration for login



***************
add experience
***************
not logged in and no session id? add anonymous account, create session

add anonymous account
	AccountService.AddAnonymous()
		add entry to session table - session ID and new User ID
			also add entry to User table

		return session ID

 create session
	ApplicationService.AddSession(sessionId, isAnonymous)

== cookies ==
1 cookie with multiple values
Session ID - NOT the user ID ...
Anonymous - true or false
